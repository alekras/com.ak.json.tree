+ 1. absolute/relative path /a/b/e, /pr::a/b/c  and so on see JPath.getNodesFromOperand()
? 2. Do I need path property at all?
+ 3. matchTemplate and $template.$match have to use composed path like: book/author/name
4. check: if all nodes cloned from source during transformation?
5. new tests for 1 and 3
6. getValue for Float and Double -> casting?
7. JPath integer index for JObject node -> f.e. take 1st child.
8. Add name-of for transformation to select not value but key of value.
