+ 1. absolute/relative path /a/b/e, /pr::a/b/c  and so on see JPath.getNodesFromOperand()
? 2. Do I need path property at all?
+ 3. matchTemplate and $template.$match have to use composed path like: book/author/name
4. check: if all nodes cloned from source during transformation?
5. new tests for 1 and 3
+ 6. getValue for Float and Double -> casting?
+ 7. JPath integer index for JObject node -> f.e. take 1st child.
+ 8. Add key-of for transformation to select not value but key of value.
9. Add exception for all null or default cases.
10. .addNode have to return reference to instance but not void. Useful while doing chain of adds...
11. Implement add of node list to array (maybe object) nodes.
